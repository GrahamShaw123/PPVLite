# PPVLite
This web page came out of a need for our vicar to run slides in services where there was no tech team presence.
It wasn't released, more escaped when our vicar found the source code in my transfer folder an tried it out!
You will need to change the IP and Port to match your machine at the top of script.js
PP needs to be running and a playlist selected
Clicking on the hamburger button should show all presentations in the active playlist (you might need to select a slide in PP first)
There are first, prev, next, and last buttons to move through the slides or each slide can be clicked to activate it
